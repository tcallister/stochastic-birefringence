# stochastic-birefringence

To run any code in this repo, you should be able to build the necessary environment via:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

At the moment, everything interesting is in the file [birefringence-demo.ipynb](birefringence-demo.ipynb), in which I very crudely estimate the stochastic background from binary black holes under various amplification levels.
